<title>Backup</title>

<p>
    Activities are stored in an SQLite database, located at
    <file>~/.local/share/hamster-time-tracker/hamster.db</file>.
    The file can be backed up and restored on the go.
    The application will reload the data automatically after a short while.
</p>
<note style="info">
    <p>
        For viewing contents of the database we can suggest using the
        <link href="https://sqlitebrowser.org/"><app>DB Browser for SQLite (DB4S)</app></link>.

        Previously the database was stored in
        <file>~/.local/share/hamster-applet/hamster.db</file>.
        Recent versions of Hamster create a hard link between the old and new
        files.  Any one of these files can be removed safely (they are
        references to the same item).  The database is lost only if both
        references are deleted.
