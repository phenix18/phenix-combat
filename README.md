# Hamster - The Gnome Time Tracker

Hamster is time tracking for individuals. It helps you to keep track of how
much time you have spent during the day on activities you choose to track.

## Installation

You can use the usually stable `master` or [download stable releases](https://github.com/projecthamster/hamster/releases).

#### Dependencies

Debian-based: `apt-get install gettext intltool python-gconf python-xdg gir1.2-gconf-2.0`

RPM-based: `yum install gettext intltool gnome-python2-gconf`

#### Building

```bash
./waf configure build --prefix=/usr
sudo ./waf install
```

If you upgraded from an existing installation make sure to kill the running
daemons:

```bash
pkill -f hamster-service
pkill -f hamster-windows-service
```

Now restart your panels/docks and you should be able to add Hamster!

#### Migrating from hamster-applet

Previously Hamster was installed everywhere under `hamster-applet`. As
the applet is long gone, the paths and file names have changed to
`hamster-time-tracker`. To clean up previous installs follow these steps:

```bash
git checkout d140d45f105d4ca07d4e33bcec1fae30143959fe
./waf configure build --prefix=/usr
sudo ./waf uninstall
```
